# Geometry Assessment Component 2
# This Component establishes the Functions that will be used to check user inputs in the program.
# ... The functions that I will use in this program include a Number Checker, a Not Blank Checker and a String Checker.

# *** Functions: ***

# Statement Generator (Finds the length of a message, and prints characters above and below that equal the
# ... length of the message) [Taken from MQA_Post_Usability_Testing_1.0 Gist created on October 29 2019]:


def statement_generator(message, character):
    print()
    print(len(message) * character)
    print(message)
    print(len(message) * character)
    print()

Welcome to the Geometry Calculator,

This program is intended for use by Intermediate School Students to assist in the completion of geometric equations.

In this program, you will be expected to enter the name of the shape type that you would like to calculate,
followed by the desired results and the required lengths that must be used.

After this, the answer to your specific result (either perimeter or area) will be given,
with the program asking whether if you would like to solve more shape problems.

Finally, after all shapes have been entered,
a summary of the working done by the program will be printed to end the program.

Please begin the program by entering the name of your desired shape.
