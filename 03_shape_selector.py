# Geometry Assessment Component 3
# This Component allows for a shape choice to be selected from a list,
# ... and improves the code set out in the previous Component.

# *** Functions: ***

# Shape Checker (Checks to see which shape the user has chosen from the options given)
# ... [This program is a customised version of the '02_yes_no_checker.py' by Ms. Gottschalk which checks shape types]

# Defines list of valid shapes to check against

valid_shapes = ["square", "circle", "rectangle", "triangle"]


def shape_choice(question):

    # Begin Loop

    valid = False
    while not valid:

        # Defines response variable

        response = input(question).lower()

        # Checks input against the valid shapes in the 'valid_shapes' list

        for item in valid_shapes:

            # If the response is in the valid shapes list, return the response

            if response == item:

                return response

            # If a single letter us entered and matches the first letter of any of the shape names,
            # ... return the shape name.

            elif response == item[0]:

                return item

        # Otherwise, print an error message
